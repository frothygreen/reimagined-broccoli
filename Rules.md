I googled 'Constraint based Creativity' and mostly landed on business sites hyping entrepreneurial creativity.
A typical expression is "working *inside* the box." 

A constraint is (supposed) to allow creative movement and is always contrasted with the (supposed) stifling quality of unlimited freedom.

How do you come up with a constraint in the first place?
Is the default unlimited freedom - something we have to cut a space out of to work in?

Maybe the default isn't freedom but preconceived constraints, ones we have a hard time getting past.
