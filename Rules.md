**further notes and refinements**

I took a little look at 'Constraint based Creativity' and mostly landed on business sites.
A tyical expression is "working *inside* the box."

A constraint is always contrasted with unlimited freedom.
It somewhow doesn't feel quite right to describe a set of formal rules as a straightforward constraint.
