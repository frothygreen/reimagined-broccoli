R: This is where we can talk to each other outside of email etc...

A: (for you) 

R: I'm digging into "constrained writing." Maybe that's what I'm most interested in Renga, not so much the details (as interesting as they might be) but the general sense of rule or constraint. I'm going to create a markdown file to gather links.

A: Hello! "constrained writing" is my jam. Really enjoyed the brief poems blog you linked.

R: Great to have you aboard!

R: Hey Alex! I tried out the Reimagined-Broccoli Wiki feature - could come in handy. I'm also re-reading Hiroaki Sato's "100 Frogs" focusing on the development of linked verse. I've added a link to a pdf of the book on our links doc.

R: Anyway, hope you and yours have a lovely Xmas!

R: Looking forward to the meeting tonight! (Jan 8)

R: Looking into the "Staging Area" on Github Desktop

R: These comments are driving me crazy Alex!

A: They're certainly a conundrum
