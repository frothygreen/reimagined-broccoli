# Reimagined Broccoli

*Fun and games writing collaborative internet poetry*

- My question here is what should this repo handle via branching vs adding editable text or [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) files?
- Something to test a few different ways.
- set out some 'writing structures' that we can start with
- maybe we could examine Japanese linked verse [Renga Wiki](https://rengarenku.fandom.com/wiki/Renku)

**Recipe:**

1. figure out the basics of Github
2. test that collaboration is working
3. work on some test cases

**add some sources of inspiration**

- [poetic web](https://poeticweb.com/)
- [HTTPoetics](https://httpoetics.bytoddwords.com/)

**other pages**

- Letters to the Editor: text file where we can "talk to each other." (set to edit for easier reading of long lines)
- Rules: Markdown file where we can play with "Constraint Sets."
- Links: Markdown file where we can add links

**recently**

- just added first Constraint Set - #1: 'Return'. Constraint-1.md
- started 2026 with a little bit of housekeeping 
- got Github Desktop working with Brackets Editor
