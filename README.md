# Reimagined Broccoli
*Fun and games writing internet poetry*

- My question here is what should this repo handle via branching vs adding editable text or [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) files?
- Something to test a few different ways.
- set out some 'writing structures' that we can start with
- maybe we could examine Japanese linked verse [Renga Wiki](https://rengarenku.fandom.com/wiki/Renku)

**Recipe:**

1. figure out the basics of Github
2. test that collaboration is working
3. work on some test cases

**add some sources of inspiration**
